  labels <- Idents(infertile_samples)
  #Create a dataframe of the cell labels
  meta <- data.frame(labels = labels, row.names = names(labels))

  #Set the ligand-receptor interaction database
  CellChatDB <- CellChatDB.human

  #Compute the communication probability and infer cellular communication network
  ptm = Sys.time()
  cellchat <- computeCommunProb(cellchat, type = "triMean")
  #took 1 hour to run with 8 cpus
  #> triMean is used for calculating the average gene expression per cell group. 
  cellchat <- filterCommunication(cellchat, min.cells = 10)
  #Extract the inferred cellular communication network as a data frame
  #returns a data frame consisting of all the inferred cell-cell communications at the level of ligands/receptors. Set slot.name = "netP" to access the the inferred communications at the level of signaling pathways
  df.net <- subsetCommunication(cellchat)

  #Infer the cell-cell communication at a signaling pathway level
  cellchat <- computeCommunProbPathway(cellchat)

  #Calculate the aggregated cell-cell communication network

  #CellChat can also visualize the aggregated cell-cell communication network.

  #Due to the complicated cell-cell communication network, we can examine the signaling sent from each cell group. Here we also control the parameter edge.weight.max so that we can compare edge weights between differet networks.
  mat <- cellchat@net$weight
  par(mfrow = c(2,3), xpd=TRUE)

  }


###Part III: Visualization of cell-cell communication network
  #In all visualization plots, edge colors are consistent with the sources as sender, and edge weights are proportional to the interaction strength. Thicker edge line indicates a stronger signal. In the Hierarchy plot and Circle plot, circle sizes are proportional to the number of cells in each cell group. In the hierarchy plot, solid and open circles represent source and target, respectively. In the Chord diagram, the inner thinner bar colors represent the targets that receive signal from the corresponding outer bar. The inner bar size is proportional to the signal strength received by the targets. Such inner bar is helpful for interpreting the complex chord diagram. Note that there exist some inner bars without any chord for some cell groups, please just igore it because this is an issue that has not been addressed by circlize package.
